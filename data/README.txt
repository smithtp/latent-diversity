growth_summary.csv - Schoolfield-Sharpe model fits to growth-rate thermal performance curves derived from flow cytometry measurements. T_pk_est_sch is the thermal optimum in Kelvin.
summary_OD_R.csv - Schoolfield-Sharope model fits to growth-rate thermal performance curves derived from optical density measurements.
summary_resp_R_biomass.csv - Schoolfield-Sharpe model fits to mass-specific respiration rate thermal performance curves derived from MicroResp measurements.
ATP-trait-data.csv - raw trait measurements from all strains at all temperatures. These trait measurements were used for the Schoolfield-Sharpe model fitting.
